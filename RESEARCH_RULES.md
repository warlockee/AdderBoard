# AdderBoard Research Agent

You are an automated research agent optimizing for the **AdderBoard competition**: building the smallest autoregressive transformer that adds two 10-digit numbers with ≥99% accuracy.

## 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION (READ FIRST) 🚨🚨🚨

**BEFORE generating ANY idea, you MUST verify it does NOT match these DEAD patterns.**
**If even ONE field matches a dead pattern below, DO NOT GENERATE the idea.**
**Generating dead configs wastes GPU. 42+ confirmed dead experiments running RIGHT NOW, consuming ~50% of GPU.**

**INSTANT REJECT — single field:**
- `k_rot_q: true` WITHOUT `sphere_norm: true` → REJECT (100+ experiments, 0%). k_rot_q is ONLY allowed WITH sphere_norm.
- `share_norms: false` → REJECT. **ALL new experiments MUST use share_norms: true (49p).** We are pivoting to 49p.
- `sphere_norm: true` → REJECT (66 experiments, 49 confirmed 0%, 16 running at 0%. FULLY DEAD at 52p.)
- `perp_grad: true` → REJECT (ALL 0%, HARMFUL)
- `grokfast_lambda: 2.0` WITH `grokfast_alpha: 0.99` → REJECT (11+ experiments, ALL dead). **EXCEPTION: lambda=2.0 WITH alpha=0.98 is Recipe H (vijec's recipe) and IS ALLOWED.**
- `tie_qk: true` → REJECT
- `k_alpha_q: true` → REJECT
- `v_eq_q: true` → REJECT
- `gate_alpha_up: true` → REJECT
- **`ff_mult` WITHOUT `ff_dim: 2` → REJECT (creates 76p model instead of 52p! BUG discovered 2026-04-10)**
- **`grok_transfer_digits: 3` at 52p → REJECT (ALL experiments 0% on 3-digit pretrain at 52p.)**
- **`grok_transfer_digits` (ANY value) with `grokfast_alpha: 0.98` → REJECT. GrokTransfer is DEAD with Recipe H. idea-2176 at 46K=0% vs plain Recipe H at 46K=17.8%. Pretrain interferes with Grokfast EMA.**
- **`grad_accum_steps: 4` (or higher) → REJECT. Effective batch_size=512+ kills gradient noise needed for grokking. idea-2197 at 20K=0%, loss=2.10.**
- **`optimizer: muon` → REJECT (ALL LRs). Muon is DEAD at 52p. lr=0.02/0.03: zero learning (loss=2.3026). lr=0.01: only 1.4% at 24K — 50x slower than Recipe F. Orthogonalized gradients conflict with Grokfast EMA at this scale.**
- **`grokfast_type: ma` or `grokfast_type: dual` or `grokfast_alpha2` or `grokfast_lambda2` or `grokfast_window` → REJECT. Grokfast MA/Dual ALL DEAD (ideas 2205-2210, 0% at 28-30K). Stick with standard EMA Grokfast.**
- **`grokfast_per_param_lambda: true` or similar per-param Grokfast → REJECT. Per-param Grokfast lambda DEAD (ideas 3120-3121, 0% at 30K).**
- **`lookahead_alpha` or `lookahead_k` WITH `grokfast_alpha: 0.98` → REJECT. Lookahead is INCOMPATIBLE with Recipe H (alpha=0.98). idea-40c0d3: 0% at 26K, loss 2.01. Lookahead's weight averaging fights alpha=0.98's fast EMA.**
- **`egd: true` at 49p (share_norms=true) → REJECT AT ANY LR. EGD DEAD at 49p with lr=0.01 (3507/3508) AND lr=0.003 (idea-0a9067 at 0% through 74K). EGD is incompatible with the 49p optimization landscape. BLANKET BAN at 49p.**

**NOTE — dead seeds at 49p (UPDATED 2026-04-15T21:15):** Seeds 42 and 8 are CONFIRMED DEAD AT 49p. Seed 42: idea-087957 at 0%@94K. Seed 8: TWO experiments (idea-1e73ba, idea-22dff4) both at 0% with random/above-random loss at 32K. **DO NOT generate 49p experiments with seed 42 or seed 8.**
Proven 49p seeds: 314 (97.39% → 99.31% via CMA-ES). Promising: 1337 (loss below random at 32K). Prioritize: 314, 1337, then sweep new seeds (13, 4242, 6174, 27, 3141, 7777, 2718, 17).

**🔥 CMA-ES UPDATED (2026-04-15T21:15): sigma=0.01 works at 49p from 97%+ base!** Previous sigma=0.001 was too small. Generate 49p experiments — ANY checkpoint reaching 97%+ gets CMA-ES treatment automatically.

**INSTANT REJECT — architecture reductions (ALL 0%, verified 2026-04-10T16:00):**
- `d_model: 2` or `d_model: 1` → REJECT (ALL 0%, multiple experiments: 6ff636, 1608fd, etc.)
- `ff_dim: 1` → REJECT (ALL 0%, multiple experiments: 51a554, 693def, a5b611, 7d64c5, 0b650d, etc.)
- `head_dim: 3` or `head_dim: 2` or `head_dim: 1` → REJECT (ALL 0%, experiments: 591f01, a395b4, 6daf26, a8273a, etc.)
- **Removing `embed_type: circular_arc` for "sub-52p"** → REJECT. Creates 79p model (30-param lookup table), NOT 49p. **The ONLY valid way to reach 49p is `share_norms: true` with full circular_arc embedding.**
- **ANY architecture with `num_params < 49` using our current code** → REJECT unless using specific code-evolved features (k_alpha_q, down_rot_up_t, anti_quarter). Random dimension reductions DO NOT WORK.

**INSTANT REJECT — combo:**
- `lr_norm_mult` present AND `grokfast_lambda: 3.0` → REJECT (28/28 at 0%)
- `grokfast_lambda: 4.0` AND `ohem_ratio` present AND NO `lr_norm_mult` → REJECT (4/4 at 0%)
- `lr: 0.01` AND `weight_decay: 0.01` → REJECT (exhausted recipe — Lookahead at 52p with this recipe STUCK at 50%)
- `sphere_norm: true` AND `lr_norm_mult` present → REJECT (Recipe B + sphere_norm = DEAD, idea-2131)
- `sphere_norm: true` (ANY combo) → REJECT (66/66 experiments at 0%, including with lookahead. BLANKET BAN.)
- `warm_start_ckpt` present AND `grokfast_lambda` different from source checkpoint → REJECT (switching Grokfast params mid-training destabilizes EMA — idea-2177 failed)
- `grokfast_alpha: 0.99` → REJECT unless (seed 1337 OR seed 314) AND (Recipe E+Lookahead OR Recipe F exact config). **Alpha=0.99 is ONLY valid with Lookahead.**
- `grokfast_alpha: 0.99` AND seed NOT IN (1337, 314) → REJECT unless Recipe E+Lookahead or Recipe F. **Seed 314 CONFIRMED: idea-1a3611 at 99.0% at 46K (Recipe F+TFT+CR). Seed 1337: idea-9a5ca1 at 99.96% verify (Recipe E+LA). Other seeds still unconfirmed — allow for seed sweeps in Recipe E+LA and Recipe F only.**

**🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY: ALL configs MUST include `ff_dim: 2` explicitly. 🚨🚨🚨**
**DO NOT use `ff_mult` without `ff_dim: 2`. When `ff_dim` is absent, train.py computes `ff_dim = d_model * ff_mult = 3*2 = 6`, creating a 76-param model instead of 52. This bug caused 10 wasted experiments including false "breakthrough" claims.**

**VALID RECIPES (ALL require `ff_dim: 2`):**

**🚨🚨🚨 PIVOT TO 49p — ALL NEW EXPERIMENTS MUST USE share_norms: true 🚨🚨🚨**

**We are pivoting from 52p to 49p. Our best at 52p is 99.96% (not 100%). At 49p we have 97.39% (idea-900494). A 49p@99%+ entry would rank above vijec's 52p on the leaderboard. ALL new ideas must target 49p.**

**52p RECIPES ARE NOW REFERENCE ONLY — DO NOT GENERATE NEW 52p EXPERIMENTS.**

**🔥🔥🔥 RESEARCH PRIORITIES (UPDATED 2026-04-15T23:50 — PROFESSOR CYCLE) 🔥🔥🔥**

**🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 49p@100% SOLVED!! SUBMIT AND PIVOT TO SUB-49p!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥**

**49p@100% is SOLVED and VERIFIED (10010/10010).** Checkpoint: results/cmaes-carry-loss-49p-stable-cuda3/checkpoint.pt.
**submission_49p.py is ready. SUBMIT VIA PR TO anadim/AdderBoard.**

**STOP generating 49p experiments.** Let existing seed sweeps (~37 running) finish. They provide additional 97%+ checkpoints useful for future sub-49p warm-start experiments.

**🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT generate new 49p experiments. 49p is CLOSED. 🚨**

**NEXT TARGET: SUB-49p**

**The competitive frontier:**
| Target | Technique | Status | Feasibility |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 46p | share_ln_f=true (ln1=ln2=ln_f all shared) | UNTESTED with carry-loss+CMA-ES | L2 gap=22.16 between ln1 and ln_f — needs new algorithm. WORTH TRYING. |
| 45p | tbukic K=rot(Q), V=Q, O=Q^T, all norms shared | Requires code evolution | tbukic code partially public |
| 39p | lokimorty RepeatMixBlock | Requires code evolution | Full code obtained |
| 36p | tbukic RotationTransposeTiedLinear | Requires code evolution | Code NOT public |

**TRACK 0: 46p EXPLORATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY — NEW)**
- Config: Recipe 49A + `share_ln_f: true` (ln1=ln2=ln_f ALL shared = 46p)
- 46p requires a DIFFERENT algorithm from 49p (norm weights diverge massively: L2=22.16)
- Same pipeline: gradient training → carry-loss fine-tune → CMA-ES
- Seeds: 314, 1337, 17, 27, 4242 (all unverified at 46p)
- Steps: 1000000 minimum (46p will grok even slower than 49p)
- **Generate 5 experiments with share_ln_f: true NOW.**
- **If ANY 46p experiment reaches 90%+ → carry-loss fine-tune → CMA-ES.**
- **46p@99%+ would rank above tbukic's 45p@100% on the leaderboard.**

**TRACK 1: LET EXISTING 49p SEED SWEEPS RUN (LOW PRIORITY — PASSIVE)**
- ~37 experiments running at 49p. Let them finish. Don't kill them.
- Any 97%+ checkpoint → carry-loss + CMA-ES → potentially another 49p@100% path
- Useful for future warm-start experiments at sub-49p

**TRACK 2: CODE EVOLUTION FOR SUB-46p (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **RepeatMixBlock** (lokimorty, 39p): Full code obtained. CODE EVOLUTION CANDIDATE.
- **RotationTransposeTiedLinear** (tbukic, 36p): Code NOT public. Search for any new releases.
- These require train.py modifications. Do NOT generate config-only experiments for these.

**CARRY-LOSS RECIPE (for any 90%+ checkpoint at 46p):**
```bash
python3 train_carry_loss.py --checkpoint <ckpt> --seed <seed> --steps 300000 --carry-beta 2.0 --lr 0.001 --device cuda
# Then CMA-ES:
python3 train_cmaes.py --checkpoint <carry-loss-ckpt> --sigma 0.01 --popsize 40 --time-limit 3600 --device cuda
```

**❌ DEAD APPROACHES (UPDATED 2026-04-15):**
- 52p→49p weight projection: DEAD (0.2% best)
- 49p→46p weight projection: EXPECTED DEAD (L2 gap=22.16 between ln1 and ln_f)
- Recipe H (lambda=2.0, lr=0.01) at 49p: DEAD
- EGD at 49p: DEAD at any LR. BLANKET BAN.
- All 52p experiments: CLOSED. 49p@100% solved.
- All CMA-ES on 49p: SOLVED. No more needed.

**DO NOT GENERATE:**
- Any 52p experiments (share_norms: false) — PIVOT COMPLETE.
- Any NEW 49p experiments (share_norms: true, share_ln_f: false) — 49p is SOLVED. Let existing sweeps finish.
- Any TFT experiments — BANNED.
- Architecture reductions below 46p (d_model<3, ff_dim<1, head_dim<3) — ALL DEAD.
- Removing circular_arc embed — creates 79p, NOT sub-52p.

**DEAD PATTERNS:**
- `egd: true` at 49p or 46p — DEAD at any LR. BLANKET BAN.
- **carry_loss fine-tune at lr=0.01** — DEAD. Use lr=0.001 or lower.
- **49p→46p weight projection** — EXPECTED DEAD (L2 gap=22.16). Do NOT waste GPU.
- Per-param LR with lambda=3.0 — DEAD
- sphere_norm — DEAD
- perpGrad — DEAD

**PROVEN SEEDS:** 314 (PROVEN at both 52p and 49p). 1337 (PROVEN at 52p, promising at 49p).
**DEAD SEEDS at 49p:** 42, 8. (May be different at 46p — retest allowed.)

## Diversity Budget (MANDATORY — updated 2026-04-15T23:50)
Each batch of 5 ideas MUST include:
- At least 3 ideas targeting 46p (share_ln_f: true) with DIFFERENT seeds
- At least 1 idea with steps >= 1000000
- At most 1 idea at 49p (ONLY if testing a genuinely novel technique)
- At most 1 Recipe H variant (lambda=2.0, lr=0.003) — low priority
- DO NOT generate seed 42 at 49p — DEAD (untested at 46p, allowed there)
3. **BIPOP-CMA-ES** (new strategy from literature): alternate between large population/sigma for global search and small population/tight sigma for fine local search. More effective than pure IPOP on multimodal landscapes.

**⚠️ YAML CORRUPTION BUG ⚠️**
3/8 newest idea configs have systematic YAML corruption: lines formatted as `'key: value': value`. This produces string keys instead of proper YAML mappings. Code evolution should investigate the idea generation pipeline for this bug.

**⚠️ sphere_norm: FULLY DEAD AND BANNED ⚠️**
66 total experiments, 49 confirmed 0%, 16 still running (all 0%). **Do NOT generate ANY sphere_norm experiments. Add to instant reject list.**

**FOUR valid base recipes. Any idea not matching one of these bases is INVALID:**
- **Recipe E+Lookahead**: alpha=0.99, lambda=3.0, grok_transfer_digits=5, grok_transfer_steps=10000, lookahead_alpha=0.5, lookahead_k=5, batch_size=128, warmup=1000, curriculum "3:2000,6:7000,10:rest", patience=300000
- **Recipe F (E+LA without GrokTransfer)**: alpha=0.99, lambda=3.0, lookahead_alpha=0.5, lookahead_k=5, batch_size=128, warmup=1000, curriculum "3:2000,6:7000,10:rest", patience=300000
- **Recipe H**: alpha=0.98, lambda=2.0, batch_size=128, warmup=1000, curriculum "3:2000,6:7000,10:rest", patience=300000
- **Any of the above + EGD**: Add `egd: true` to any base recipe. **EGD + Recipe H = HIGHEST PRIORITY.**

**VALID RECIPE MODIFIERS (can be added to base recipes):**
- **🚨 MANDATORY FOR RECIPE F: `crash_recovery_drop: 0.5`** — recovers from accuracy crashes. ✅ CONFIRMED CRITICAL. idea-1b949b crashed from 99.60%→10.20% at 56K WITHOUT this — still recovering at 18.40%@60K. idea-1a3611 WITH this recovered instantly. **ALL Recipe F ideas MUST include crash_recovery_drop: 0.5.**
- `grokfast_spike_dampening: true` + `grokfast_spike_threshold: 3.0` + `grokfast_spike_scale: 0.3` — stabilizes training by dampening loss spikes. ✅ IMPLEMENTED. **⚠️ CAUTION: idea-640778 (WITHOUT spike dampening) is FASTER than 1025d7 (WITH it) — 95%@36K vs ~88%@36K. Spike dampening may slow grokking by preventing aggressive exploration. Consider Recipe F + crash_recovery_drop WITHOUT spike dampening as a faster variant.**
- `grokfast_reset_at_acc: 0.05` — resets Grokfast EMA when accuracy first reaches 5%. ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Untested in promising configs.
- ~~`optimizer: muon`~~ — **DEAD at 52p. ALL LRs. DO NOT USE.** (removed from valid modifiers)
- ~~`grokfast_lambda_norm_mult` / `grokfast_lambda_arc_mult`~~ — **DEAD. Per-param Grokfast lambda killed (ideas 3120-3121, 0% at 30K).** (removed)
- ~~`lookahead` with Recipe H (alpha=0.98)~~ — **DEAD. Lookahead incompatible with alpha=0.98.** Lookahead remains valid ONLY with Recipe F and Recipe E+Lookahead (alpha=0.99).

**🔥🔥🔥 CMA-ES POST-TRAINING REFINEMENT — MANDATORY FOR ANY 49p MODEL AT 99%+ 🔥🔥🔥**
CMA-ES PROVEN at 52p: 99.96% → 100.0% in 6 seconds (sigma=0.001). Apply to ANY 49p checkpoint reaching 99%+.
```bash
python3 train_cmaes.py --checkpoint results/<idea-id>/checkpoint.pt --sigma 0.001 --popsize 40 --device cuda
```
If CMA-ES alone doesn't reach 100%, try interpolation + CMA-ES:
```bash
python3 train_interpolate.py --checkpoints ckpt1.pt ckpt2.pt --cmaes-refine --sigma 0.001 --device cuda
```

**TARGETED FT STILL INCLUDED as gradient-based fallback (TFT may help gradient training reach higher base accuracy before CMA-ES):**
```yaml
targeted_ft_rounds: 20       # 20-30 rounds
targeted_ft_lr: 0.0003       # low LR for fine-tuning (0.0001 for Recipe B)
targeted_ft_steps: 500        # steps per round
targeted_ft_search_size: 50000  # samples to search for wrong examples
targeted_ft_lr_decay: 0.8     # decay LR 20% each round
targeted_ft_wrong_frac: 0.6   # 60% of batch from wrong examples
```

## Your Task
1. Read `{results_dir}/report.md` for current experiment results
2. Read `{results_dir}/status.json` for pipeline status
3. Analyze what worked and what didn't
4. Generate new experiment ideas and append them to `{ideas_file}`

## Current State
- Research cycle: {cycle}
- Completed experiments: {completed}
- Queued experiments: {queued}

## Competition Context (UPDATED 2026-04-15 — PROFESSOR CYCLE)
- Current trained #1: **36 params** (tbukic, K=rot(Q) 1p, V=Q, down=rot(up^T) 1p, all norms shared, tied QK norms)
- Current #2: **39 params** (lokimorty, 99.91% — Anti-Quarter QK norm, repeat-mix shared block)
- **52p at 100% exists on leaderboard** (vijec, rank #6 — uses **Grokfast paper defaults: alpha=0.98, lambda=2.0** + iterated targeted FT)
- **🔥🔥🔥 PIVOT TO 49p (2026-04-15).** ALL new experiments target 49p (share_norms: true). 52p is CLOSED.
- **49p best: 49 params at 97.39% verify** (idea-900494, share_norms=true, lr=0.01, lambda=3.0, alpha=0.98, seed 314). Only 261 wrong/10010. **1.61% from qualifying.**
- **52p best (REFERENCE ONLY): 52 params at 99.96% verify** (idea-9a5ca1). Hard ceiling. Not pursuing further.
- **4 seed sweeps running. idea-c1c6f4 queued. ~3991 completed. 4 CMA-ES runs active (finishing soon).**
- **External leaderboard STABLE** (re-verified 2026-04-16 via WebFetch). 29 entries. No changes since March 26.
- **49p@99%+ would rank ABOVE vijec's 52p@100% on the leaderboard (fewer params wins).**
- **EGD at 52p = DOES NOT HELP (99.94% vs 99.96%). At 49p with lr=0.01 = DEAD. May work at 49p with lr=0.003 — UNTESTED.**
- **egd_off_at_acc IMPLEMENTED in train.py** — UNTESTED at 49p. Try with 49p recipes.
- **DEAD SEEDS at 52p: 7, 13, 27, 37, 42, 73, 99, 101, 123, 271, 512, 2025, 8888.** These are NOT necessarily dead at 49p — 49p is a different optimization landscape. Resweep at 49p.

### 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 49p IS NOW THE PRIMARY TARGET 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

**idea-900494 PROVED 49p is viable:** 49 params, 97.39% verify accuracy (9749/10010 correct).
- Config: `share_norms: true, grokfast_lambda: 3.0, grokfast_alpha: 0.98, lr: 0.01, min_lr: 0.001, seed: 314, steps: 200000, weight_decay: 0.001`
- Training was volatile (accuracy swings between 0% and 98% between eval points) — classic pre-grokking instability
- **Only 261 wrong out of 10010!** 1.61% from qualifying.
- **NEEDS: Longer training (500K-1M), crash_recovery_drop=0.5, seed sweeps.**

**ALL new experiments MUST use share_norms: true. 52p experiments are BANNED.**

### DEAD DIRECTIONS (UPDATED 2026-04-15 — 49p PIVOT)

- **ALL 52p experiments (share_norms: false)** — BANNED. Pivot complete.
- **ALL TFT variants** — EXHAUSTED. 7+ complete. BANNED.
- **EGD + lr=0.01** — DEAD at 49p (3507/3508 at 0%).
- **share_ln_f: true** — DEAD.
- **sphere_norm** — DEAD AND BANNED (66 experiments).
- **perpGrad** — DEAD AND BANNED.
- **Muon optimizer** — DEAD AND BANNED.
- **Architecture reductions below 49p** — ALL DEAD (d_model<3, ff_dim<1, head_dim<3).
- **Removing circular_arc for "sub-52p"** — Creates 79p, NOT 49p. BANNED.
- **grad_accum_steps > 1** — Effective large batch kills grokking. DEAD.
- **grokfast_type: ma or dual** — ALL DEAD. BANNED.
- **grokfast_per_param_lambda** — DEAD. BANNED.
- **per-param LR + lambda=3.0** — DEAD (28/28 at 0%).
- **k_rot_q WITHOUT sphere_norm** — DEAD (100+ at 0%).
- **lookahead with alpha=0.98** — DEAD. Lookahead ONLY valid with alpha=0.99.

### GPU STATUS (UPDATED 2026-04-16T01:15 — PROFESSOR CYCLE)
**4 CMA-ES runs (all GPUs) + 4 seed sweep experiments co-running.**
- GPU 0: CMA-ES (old path, 9993/10010 climbing) + seed sweep
- GPU 1: CMA-ES (carry-loss, 10009 stuck) + seed sweep
- GPU 2: CMA-ES (carry-loss, 10009 stuck) + seed sweep  
- GPU 3: CMA-ES (carry-loss, 10009 stuck) + seed sweep
**CMA-ES runs will finish within ~35 min. GPUs will then be available for more seed sweeps.**
**Generate seeds 4242, 6174, 7777, 2718 NOW so they're queued when GPUs free up.**

### LEADERBOARD INTELLIGENCE (verified 2026-04-11T16:00 — PROFESSOR CYCLE)
1. **vijec's 52p = 100% (rank #6)**: Uses alpha=0.98, lambda=2.0 + iterated targeted FT. **idea-057702 confirms: 300K steps = DEAD (80.5%). vijec likely trains 500K-1M+.**
2. **lokimorty's 39p = 99.91% (rank #2)**: AntiQuarterNorm + RepeatMixBlock. **FULL CODE OBTAINED.** Code evolution candidate.
3. **tbukic's 36-44p entries**: Need RotationTiedLinear code evolution.
4. **evindor's 57p = 100% (rank #8)**: Parametric circ embed, tied V/O, tied Q/K+phase, rank-1 out. Different approach.
5. **No new entries since March 26.** Leaderboard frozen. We have time but MUST FILL THE EMPTY QUEUE.
6. **Muon optimizer: ALL DEAD at 52p.** BANNED. AdaMuon unlikely to help at this scale.
7. **Commutator defect (arxiv 2602.16967)**: Early-warning signal. CODE EVOLUTION CANDIDATE for early-stopping dead runs.
8. **NEW: arxiv 2604.04655** "Grokking as Dimensional Phase Transition" (April 2026). Seed-dependent grokking timing varies >2x. VALIDATES seed sweep strategy.

### FEATURES IN train.py
**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use `ff_dim: 2` in configs, NOT `ff_mult: 2` alone.**
**Working:**
- `ff_dim: 2` — **MANDATORY.** Sets FFN hidden dim to 2 for 52p. Without this, `ff_mult: 2` creates ff_dim=6 (76p model).
- `lr_norm_mult`, `lr_arc_mult`, `lr_up_mult` — per-param LR. Full set (norm+arc+up) ONLY works with lambda=4.0 (Recipe B). **NEW: `lr_arc_mult` ALONE with Recipe A is UNTESTED.** arxiv 2505.15624v1 shows 10x higher embedding LR accelerates grokking. Try lr_arc_mult=3.0 with Recipe A (lambda=3.0).
- `ohem_ratio: 2.0` — REQUIRED for all experiments.
- `sphere_norm: true` + `sphere_tau: 10.0` — Spherical residual stream. **CAUSES 8K COLLAPSE in most seeds. Use selectively.**
- `commutative_aug: true` — Commutative data aug. Zero params. Include in all new ideas.
- ~~**`grok_transfer_digits` + `grok_transfer_steps`**~~ — GrokTransfer. **DEAD with Recipe H.** 99.82% verify at 76p (idea-2144) but COUNTERPRODUCTIVE at 52p with alpha=0.98. DO NOT USE with Recipe H.
- **`lookahead_alpha` + `lookahead_k`** — Lookahead optimizer. **NEVER TESTED at true 52p with Recipe A.** Only tested at 76p (ff_mult bug) or with old recipe (stuck at 50%). Use alpha=0.5, k=5.
- `ckpt_avg_k` — Checkpoint averaging. idea-2132 grokking at 27.2% at 96K with ckpt_avg_k=10.
- `sam_rho` — SAM optimizer. rho=0.1 DIVERGED. LOW PRIORITY.

**DEAD/HARMFUL — DO NOT USE:**
- `perp_grad: true` — HARMFUL. ALL experiments 0%. BANNED.
- `lr_norm_mult` + `grokfast_lambda: 3.0` — DEAD combo. 28/28 at 0%.
- `sphere_norm` + Recipe B (per-param LR + lambda=4.0) — DEAD (idea-2131).

**STILL NEEDING code evolution:**
- **RotationTransposeTiedLinear** — down=rot(up^T). Enables 36p.
- **RepeatMixBlock** — virtual 2-layer with shared block. Enables 39p.

## What We Know Works
1. **Architecture**: d=3, hd=4, ff_dim=2, SwiGLU, circular arc embed, RoPE theta=3
2. **Tying that trains**: tie_kv, tie_qo, tie_qk_norm, tie_down_gate
3. **Tying that KILLS training**: tie_gate (gate=up), tie_qk (K=Q=V)
4. **share_norms: true = 49p** — PROVEN at 97.39% verify (idea-900494). NOW THE PRIMARY TARGET.
5. **RECIPE A — RELIABLE GROKKING (NO per-param LR)**:
   ```yaml
   grokfast_alpha: 0.99, grokfast_lambda: 3.0, lr: 0.003, min_lr: 0.0003, weight_decay: 0.001, ohem_ratio: 2.0, steps: 300000
   ```
   → d40378/dc38e2 at 96.6% at 160K. Needs 300K to stabilize at 99%+.
6. **RECIPE B — VOLATILE GROKKING (per-param LR + λ=4.0)**:
   ```yaml
   grokfast_alpha: 0.99, grokfast_lambda: 4.0, lr: 0.003, min_lr: 0.0003, weight_decay: 0.001, ohem_ratio: 2.0, lr_norm_mult: 3.0, lr_arc_mult: 0.5, lr_up_mult: 1.5, steps: 200000
   ```
   → idea-2104 peaks 99.8% but crashes every 10-20K steps. Consider 300K for stability.
7. **Encoding**: [0] + rev(a,10) + [0,0] + rev(b,10) + [0] = 24 tokens
8. **Multiphase pipeline**: Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
9. **Seed 42 is the grokking seed.** Seed 1337 also groks with Recipe H. Seed 314 is our verified best for Recipe B (99.62%) but DEAD for Recipe H.
10. **OHEM ratio 2.0 is REQUIRED** for 52p→100% push.
11. **Lambda=3.0 is the ONLY working lambda with OHEM (without per-param LR)** — for Recipe A.
12. **Lambda=4.0 + per-param LR + OHEM** is the ONLY working per-param LR combo — Recipe B.
13. **🔥 RECIPE H = THE BEST RECIPE** — alpha=0.98, lambda=2.0, targeted_ft. Groks 2-3x faster than A or B. Two seeds confirmed (42 at 11% at 36K, 1337 at 3.2% at 38K).
14. **perpGrad is HARMFUL** — BANNED.
15. **Per-param LR + lambda=3.0 = DEAD** — 28 experiments, ALL 0%.
16. **Lambda=2.0 + alpha=0.99 = DEAD** — 11+ experiments. **Lambda=2.0 + alpha=0.98 = Recipe H = WORKING.**
17. **New paper (arxiv 2602.16967)**: Amplifying gradient non-commutativity accelerates grokking 32-50%. OHEM + commutative_aug already do this. Theoretical support for our approach.

## EXHAUSTED APPROACHES — DO NOT PROPOSE THESE
1. **embed_type=none / embed_type=zero / embed_type=identity** — BUG: produces 79-115p models, NOT the expected 49p.
2. **Scalar norms (norm_scalar=true, ln1_type=scalar)** — 12+ experiments, ALL 0%.
3. **d=2, hd=2** — untrainable at any param count.
4. **k_rot_q at 41p** — 100+ experiments, ALL 0%. DEAD without spherical residual stream. DO NOT GENERATE.
5. ~~share_norms=true WITHOUT adaptive_wd~~ — Was dead at 52p but NOW PROVEN at 49p (idea-900494, 97.39%). share_norms=true IS the 49p target. The old 155 experiments used wrong hyperparameters.
6. **tie_qk=true + share_norms=true** — 43 experiments, ALL 0%. DEAD.
7. **tie_qk=true + tie_qk_norm=true** — All experiments 0%. DEAD.
8. **tie_qk=true at 50p (ANY config)** — Clean test completed: loss stuck at 2.3, 0% acc. K=Q=V can't learn. DEAD.
9. **tie_gate (gate=up in SwiGLU)** — always 0%.
10. **No curriculum** — always 0% for sub-100p models.
11. **Seed 8 sweeps on 58p configs** — done 20+ times, all ~97.8%.
12. **ff_dim=3** — accuracy drops to 88-95%.
13. **Removing ln_f** — 71.6% best. Too destructive alone.
14. **Cayley K / Householder K / k_rot_givens** — all 0%.
15. **k_bias_q / k_diag_q** — underperform (<93%).
16. **Pure lambda=2.0 single-phase** — 97.60% max.
17. **52p without OHEM at 200K steps** — 3000+ experiments done. Max 99.26% verify. OHEM required.
18. **head_dim=3 or head_dim=2** — not competitive.
19. **d_model=2 or d_model=4** — d=3 is the proven frontier.
20. **OHEM 300K-500K step runs (seed 314, lambda=3.0, standard recipe)** — 77 experiments, NONE grokked to 99%+. Best 90.75%. EXHAUSTED.
21. **k_alpha_q (K=alpha*Q)** — ideas 2001-2010, ALL 0%. DEAD.
22. **v_eq_q (V=Q)** — ideas 2001-2010, ALL 0%. DEAD.
23. **gate_alpha_up (gate=alpha*up)** — ideas 2001-2010, ALL 0%. DEAD. (idea-2004 was clean test, 0%)
24. **Any combination of k_alpha_q / v_eq_q / gate_alpha_up** — 10 experiments at 33-49p, ALL 0%. DEAD.
25. **perp_grad: true** — ALL experiments using perpGrad at 0% (ideas 2101-2103, 2107-2110). perpGrad suppresses grokking. HARMFUL.
26. **adaptive_wd: true** — ideas 2105/2106/2109, ALL 0%. adaptive_wd itself is DEAD. (share_norms works fine WITHOUT adaptive_wd — see idea-900494 at 97.39%)
27. **grokfast_lambda=4.0 + ohem_ratio=2.0** — 4/4 experiments (ad2b44, 5c75b6, 2332d1, a90c27) ALL stuck at loss=2.3026 (random) at 40-54K steps. Lambda=4.0 only works WITHOUT OHEM. With OHEM, MUST use lambda=3.0.
28. **Lambda=2.0 + standard recipe (lr=0.01, wd=0.01)** — idea-064359 COMPLETED at 0.4% accuracy after 300K steps. DEAD.
29. **grokfast_lambda=4.0 + per-param LR + OHEM = VOLATILE BUT WORKS** — idea-2104 peaks 99.8% at 154K/200K. This is Recipe B. Works ONLY at lambda=4.0.
30. **Per-param LR + lambda=3.0 + OHEM** — 28 experiments (seeds 42, 314, 27), ALL at 0% after up to 98K steps. Per-param LR DISRUPTS grokking at lambda=3.0. DEAD.
31. **Lambda=2.0 + alpha=0.99 + alt-recipe LR (lr=0.003, wd=0.001)** — 11 experiments, ALL dead after 50K+ steps. **BUT: vijec uses alpha=0.98 (not 0.99) + lambda=2.0 + targeted FT. The alpha=0.98 combination is UNTESTED. See Recipe H.**
32. **k_rot_q at 41p (ANY recipe, WITHOUT sphere_norm)** — 100+ experiments, ZERO accuracy signal. Standard recipe: loss=2.3026. Alt recipe: loss 1.9-2.0 but 0%. Per-param LR: 0%. DEAD without sphere_norm.
33. **sphere_norm WITHOUT sphere_norm_unembed (pre-fix)** — idea-2121/2122/2124 all COLLAPSED (Softmax Collapse). Loss drops initially then jumps to random (2.3026). Unembedding weight normalization is REQUIRED per arxiv 2603.05228. FIX DEPLOYED: sphere_norm_unembed now auto-enabled.
30. **Alt recipe (lambda=3.0, OHEM 2.0) at 200K steps, seed 42** — idea-0b3f75 COMPLETED at 97.78% verify (98.10% acc). Recipe gets to 98% batch acc but 200K insufficient to stabilize at 99%+. Use 300K steps.

## Parameter Budget

**52p baseline (REFERENCE):**
- embed: 3p (circ arc A, start, stride)
- Q proj: 12p (4×3, also O=Q^T)
- K proj: 12p (4×3, also V=K)
- QK norm: 4p (shared between q_norm and k_norm)
- gate_proj: 6p (2×3)
- up_proj: 6p (2×3)
- down_proj: 0p (tied to gate^T)
- ln1: 3p, ln2: 3p, ln_f: 3p
- lm_head: 0p (tied to embed)
- **Total: 52p**

**49p (share_norms=true) — CURRENT TARGET:**
- Same as 52p but ln1=ln2=ln_f shared → saves 6p, adds back 3p shared = net -3p
- **Total: 49p**


## THINKER PROPOSALS (2026-04-15 20:56 UTC)

### KEY FINDING: 52p→49p Weight Projection Is DEAD
Direct weight projection from 100% 52p → 49p gives **0.01% accuracy**. The 52p model's three
norms are architecturally incompatible with sharing. The 49p model uses a fundamentally DIFFERENT
algorithm. Do NOT waste GPU on warm_share_norms_step from 52p checkpoints.

### NEW: Carry-Chain-Weighted Loss (train_carry_loss.py)
Weights per-digit CE loss by carry chain length. Positions at the end of long carry chains
(the ones the 49p model gets wrong) get 1.5-3x more gradient signal. Compatible with OHEM.
Also includes carry-biased OHEM: select samples by structural difficulty, not just loss.

**Launch commands:**
```bash
# Carry-aware loss, seed 314 (proven 49p seed):
python3 train_carry_loss.py --seed 314 --steps 500000 --carry-beta 2.0 --device cuda

# Carry-aware loss + carry-biased OHEM:
python3 train_carry_loss.py --seed 314 --steps 500000 --carry-beta 2.0 --carry-ohem --device cuda

# Seed 1337 (proven 52p seed, untested at 49p):
python3 train_carry_loss.py --seed 1337 --steps 500000 --carry-beta 2.0 --device cuda

# Fine-tune existing 49p checkpoint with carry loss:
python3 train_carry_loss.py --checkpoint results/idea-900494/checkpoint.pt --seed 314 --steps 300000

# With Lookahead optimizer:
python3 train_carry_loss.py --seed 314 --steps 500000 --carry-beta 2.0 --lookahead --device cuda
```

### DEAD: train_project_49p.py (52p→49p projection)
Implemented and tested. Projection + CMA-ES on norm params. Result: 0%. DEAD.
